One path required one year of practice with proof of Arizona residency, while the other required three years without a residency requirement. Additionally, applicants were required to pay fees, provide fingerprints, complete a tutorial, submit ID, verify credentials, and prove residency if applying under the one-year practice and Arizona residency requirement.
